## Description
The project is a visualization and search interface for graduate internship abstracts. It is a web interface to display, filter, and search the public abstracts of the applied research internship projects carried out by students from the MScAC program at the University of Toronto. Our partner is Daniel Giovannini, the Associate Director for MScAC Partnerships. We are planning to build an interactive, searchable website that is both desktop- and mobile-friendly.

## General Info 
Our application is a web interface that allows easy browsing, filtering, and searching of public abstracts of applied research internship projects carried out by MScAC students at the University of Toronto. It aims to attract technical talent at the graduate level and promote university research collaborations. The platform is designed to meet the needs of both students and industry partners and will be interactive, searchable, and responsive on desktop and mobile devices. With guidance from the Associate Director for MScAC Partnerships, we aim to create an informative and engaging website for all stakeholders.

## How to use
Go to the webpage by clicking the following URL: https://mscacresearch.netlify.app/

## Features 
### 1.	Home page interface: 
The link below will direct the user to the home page of the website. Several internship projects would show up at the bottom of the page. If the user is interested in one of the projects and clicks on the project name, the user would be directed to the project page, which includes more specific details such as the project abstract, organization, and supervisor. Alternatively, if the user clicks on the link of the organization or supervisor, the user would be promoted to the company’s website or the supervisor’s profile page.

### 2.	Navigation bar: 
At the top of the page is the navigation bar, where “Home”, “Contact” and “About” are listed. Clicking on each button would prompt the corresponding pages for information about the website (fake information for now).

### 3.	Filtering function: 
There are three scrollable filters for users to use. If the user clicks on the filter, the available options will show up, and by clicking on one of the options, the selected option will replace the word in the filtering box to let the user know which option is chosen. In the next assignment, we will improve this to be a searchable filter, where users can directly search for the option they want. 

Filtering by year will display projects posted in a particular year. Filtering by the organization will return projects carried out by that organization, and filtering by the academic supervisor will show projects supervised by a specific supervisor. For D2, the searching function restricting to these filter values are still under construction.

### 4.	Searching function: 
The search box on the webpage offers a convenient way for users to find specific projects that match their interests. By entering relevant search terms into the search box, users can perform a full-text search that will return all projects containing those terms. This means that the search results will include all projects that mention the entered terms, even if the terms appear in the project's description, title, or other related information. The search function provides a powerful and flexible tool for users to locate projects that match their specific needs or interests. It enables users to quickly and easily find projects related to a particular topic or keyword, making it a highly effective way to navigate through large amounts of project data. It would prompt the user to the results page where the projects that include the search term would be listed. If no results are found, the page would show “No matched results”. In the next assignment, projects with same title but performed by different students, such as the example shown in Figure (B) below, would be merged into one.

Figure 4. (A) Figure shows the case when no results are found with the term “kjahsdf”.
(B)The result page would contain the project whose name contains “network”. 
(C) By clicking on the “Details” button, the detailed information about the project would be displayed.

### 5.	Tags: 
Beneath the search box, you will find a list of tags that are currently trending and represent popular topics of interest. These tags are used to categorize the content and make it easier for users to locate relevant information quickly. Some examples of these popular tags include "machine learning" and "robotics," which are frequently searched for by users. By clicking on these tags, users can view all the content related to that particular topic, enabling them to access the most relevant and up-to-date information available.

## How are tasks managed
 
__**git clone**__ team repository to local
* If clone failed due to authentication, or the repo is private and prevents editing access for teammates, either use a personal access token, or caching GitHub credentials by log into Git through terminal once to allow Git cache account information and permit access to the private repo.

__**git remote -v**__ to set the origin

Frontend and backend work separately and include README file which includes instruction for use.

In local, __**git pull**__ each time before editing the code to fetch the latest data.

After coding is completed, __**git add**__ to add the modified files.

__**git commit**__ with informative message.

__**git push**__ to main branch.
